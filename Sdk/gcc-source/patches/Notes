These notes are included in the tarball as well.

Here are the remaining pieces, as of the time this is sent,
needed for Interix and binutils.  Each file has annotations
at the front of it as to its purpose and current status.
The list is too long, and too dynamic, to summarize here.

"Currently being applied" means that I'm using the patch in
my (ir)regular builds, and that it worked properly (in concert
with all the others).  I can't, of course, promise that there
haven't been changes to the baseline that would break them.

Note that I've inlcuded the Alpha patches.  I believe that,
even tho Compaq is dropping the Alpha, that they continue to
have value.  There is an ongoing support issue, of course.
More importantly, they fix/implement a lot of features for 
PE in general (X86 PE is a special case; all RISCs are more
similar to each other than to X86).  Such features may be
needed on future NT RISC (or other?) ports.

If/when I get the chance, I will submit cleaned up Alpha
patches.

There is no bfd/41*, ld/21*

Only gdb/19* exists.  I have today (8/31) submitted to RMS a release
for gdb.
