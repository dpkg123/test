Numbered files are patches that have not yet been applied.  Some have
been submitted.

applyem is the current (as of 5/12/99) list of patches I'm actually
applying that have not been applied to egcs.

x.number files are false starts, work in progress, etc.

p.* are potential groups of patches that haven't been vetted at all.

Other files are leftovers

Directories are self-explanatory.
