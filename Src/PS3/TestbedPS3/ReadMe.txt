    CONSOLE APPLICATION : TestbedPS3 Project Overview
========================================================================

This program runs a PS3 Unreal executable and tries to detect that it
runs until the 2nd rendered frame without interruption.

Run the program without parameters for a brief documentation.


Some notes:

1. Remember to run the executable from where PS3CommandLine.txt is supposed
   to be located.

2. Have one target already connected in SN Target Manager. You can
   also set the SN environment variable PS3TARGET instead. See SN docs.

3. Have ps3run.exe and ppu-lv2-addr2line accessible thru the PATH
   environment variable.
